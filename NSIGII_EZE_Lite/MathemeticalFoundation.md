Key Mathematical Foundations
1. Fourier Synthesis:
   square_wave(x) = (4/π) * Σ sin((2n-1)x)/(2n-1)
                  for n = 1 to ∞ (odd harmonics)

2. Derivative Termination:
   For polynomial of degree n:
   f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(x) = 0

3. Matrix Operations:
   Determinant of 2x2: |a b| = ad - bc
                       |c d|

4. Quadratic Formula:
   x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

5. Complex Numbers:
   e^(iπ) = -1 (Euler's identity)

6. Sparse Data Model:
   Active nodes = Total nodes / 4
   Shared data = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2
